ScalaMeter 0.4-M2 for Scala 2.10.0 has just been released!

This milestone release features the final implementation of the HTML reporters based on the D3 visualization library.
You can see a live example of the report page [here](http://chara.epfl.ch/~prokopec/example/tmp/report/).
This new HTML reporter is the default reporter used in `PerformanceTest.Regression` tests.

Some of its features are:
- x-axis choice for composed generators -- allows choosing whether problem size, parallelism level or the measurement date are on the x-axis
- chart and histogram view of the measurements
- confidence interval display
- filtering input parameters interactively
- choosing tests from different test groups interactively
- permalinks that allow sharing the chosen configuration of displayed test groups and input parameters
- list goes on ...

The new HTML reporter is entirely a contribution by [Roman Zoller](https://github.com/rzoller). Excellent work, Roman!

If you are using Maven, you can add ScalaMeter 0.4-M2 as a dependency at Sonatype OSS.

    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.github.axel22</groupId>
      <artifactId>scalameter_2.10</artifactId>
      <version>0.4-M2</version>
    </dependency>

Or, in SBT:

    resolvers += "Sonatype OSS Snapshots" at
      "https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots"

    libraryDependencies += "com.github.axel22" %% "scalameter" % "0.4-M2"
