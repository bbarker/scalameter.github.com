title: Released ScalaMeter 0.7 for Scala 2.10 and 2.11
poster: Alex

ScalaMeter 0.7 for Scala 2.10 and Scala 2.11 has just been released!

This ScalaMeter release is due to a hugely successful
Google Summer of Code 2015 project --
the star of the release is [Krzysztof Janosz](https://github.com/kjanosz),
whose valiant efforts brought ScalaMeter to a new level.

Also, thanks to all the
[committers and people who contributed](http://scalameter.github.io/home/authors/)
in any way,
including submitting valuable feedback.
We were able to follow up on some of the suggestions in the 0.7 release,
and we plan to continue to do so in the future.
Still, we invite you to help by contributing patches, bugfixes,
new features, and extensions!


### New Features

- Standalone [SBT examples projects](https://github.com/scalameter/scalameter-examples).
- Backwards-compatible JSON-based persistors:
  [`JSONSerializationPersistor` and `GZIPJSONSerializationPersistor`](http://scalameter.github.io/home/gettingstarted/0.7/persistors/index.html).
- Add [`Measurer.BoxingCount`](http://scalameter.github.io/home/gettingstarted/0.7/executors/index.html)
  that can measure (auto)boxing of Scala primitives.
- Add [`Measurer.MethodInvocationCount`](http://scalameter.github.io/home/gettingstarted/0.7/executors/index.html)
  that can count invocation of arbitrary methods.
- Add [`JBench`](http://scalameter.github.io/home/gettingstarted/0.7/javausage/index.html)
  and entire new annotation-based Java API.
- Add `include(new BenchTrait {})` statement used to include benchmark templates that
  are themselves not standalone tests, but can be used only with `include`.
  These new `include` statements can only be invoked from `Bench.Group` benchmark type.
  See example
  [here](https://github.com/scalameter/scalameter-examples/include-statements).
  For rationale, see mailing list
  [discussion](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/scalameter/D3bf57PEhDo).


### Changes

- Make [`GZIPJSONSerializationPersistor`](http://scalameter.github.io/home/gettingstarted/0.7/persistors/index.html)
  default for regression testing.
- Rename `PerformanceTest` to `Bench`.
- The `Bench` class (formerly `PerformanceTest`) now takes a type parameter that
  describes the type of the results it produces. For most benchmark types, this is
  just `Double`, but some benchmark types measure running time profiles or method
  invocation counts and have different results. The `Reporter` and `Measurer` must
  have the same type as the benchmark itself.
- Change default directory for the benchmark results to `target/benchmarks`.


### Deprecated

- Move and mark as deprecated `JavaPerformanceTest` and
  its components to `org.scalameter.deprecatedjapi`.
- Add compatibility type alias `PerformanceTest` for
  `org.scalameter.Bench` in api package.
- Deprecate `include[BenchClass]` statement in favor of `include(new BenchTrait {})`
  (the `BenchTrait` is a normal benchmark, but must be implemented in a Scala trait).


### Fixed

- Fix lack of default `reportDir` when running benchmarks using `main` method.
- Improve [release process](http://scalameter.github.io/home/releasing/).


You can add ScalaMeter as an SBT dependency at Sonatype OSS for Scala 2.10 projects:

    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.storm-enroute</groupId>
      <artifactId>scalameter_2.10</artifactId>
      <version>0.7</version>
    </dependency>

Or, for Scala 2.11 projects:

    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.storm-enroute</groupId>
      <artifactId>scalameter_2.11</artifactId>
      <version>0.7</version>
    </dependency>

Or, in SBT, just:

    resolvers += "Sonatype OSS Snapshots" at
      "https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/releases"

    libraryDependencies += "com.storm-enroute" %% "scalameter" % "0.7"

To only use the inline benchmarking features, use the `scalameter-core` module:

    libraryDependencies += "com.storm-enroute" %% "scalameter-core" % "0.7"
