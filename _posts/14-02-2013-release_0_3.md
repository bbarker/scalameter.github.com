ScalaMeter 0.3 for Scala 2.10.0 has just been released!

New features and fixes:
- paths allowed in the `resultDir` property
- works on JDK 1.6 with the `preJDK7` flag, although with increased warmup times
- easier to create benchmarks with the default reinstantiation frequency
- new chart types
- and many fixes

You can add it as an SBT dependency at Sonatype OSS.

    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.github.axel22</groupId>
      <artifactId>scalameter_2.10</artifactId>
      <version>0.3</version>
    </dependency>

Or, in SBT:

    resolvers += "Sonatype OSS Snapshots" at
      "https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots"

    libraryDependencies += "com.github.axel22" %% "scalameter" % "0.3"
